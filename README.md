# ZT Process Killer

### Continuous Integration 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer.png)](https://travis-ci.org/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer)

### Quick Overview

The project was created in [ZeroTurnaround](http://zeroturnaround.com/) to have a stable base functionality of stopping running processes from Java.
It can stop processes started from Java (e.g. with [zt-exec](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec)) as well as existing system processes based on their process ID (PID).

### Installation
[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer)

The project artifacts are available in [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C636943745).

To include it in your maven project then you have to specify the dependency.

```xml
...
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.zeroturnaround</groupId>
    <artifactId>zt-process-killer</artifactId>
    <version>1.11</version>
</dependency>
...
```

### Motivation

In Java [Process.destroy()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html#destroy--) is ambiguous.
On Windows it terminates processes forcibly. On UNIX it terminates them gracefully.
As invoking **kill** commands from Java is errorprone it should have an advised API and good test coverage.

We had the following functional requirements:

* check whether a process is alive
* wait until a process has finished
* terminate a process gracefully (by default disabled on Windows as it's unsupported - [WindowsProcess](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/WindowsProcess.java))
* terminate a process forcibly
* get the process ID (PID) of running JVM

and these non-functional requirements:

* abstraction of processes regardless they are started from Java or not (use process ID) - [SystemProcess](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/SystemProcess.java)
* have process API similar to [java.lang.Process](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html) 
* all waiting methods should have one version with timeout and another without it 
* stopping operation should be idempotent - if a process was already finished it is a success 
* separate generic behavior from process implementation - [ProcessUtil](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/ProcessUtil.java)
* support alternative implementations for stopping same process - [OrProcess](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/OrProcess.java)
* simple factory for creating process instances - [Processes](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/Processes.java)
* invoke Java 8 **java.lang.Process** methods if possible - [Java8Process](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/Java8Process.java)

Limitations:

* As the process abstraction is also used for already running processes it can't access their streams or exit value.
* The scope of this project is stopping single processes. However [WindowsProcess](https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-process-killer/blob/master/src/main/java/org/zeroturnaround/process/WindowsProcess.java)
has method **setIncludeChildren** to also stop child processes in case the root process is still running.

### Examples

* Get my PID

```java
int pid = PidUtil.getMyPid();
System.out.println("My PID is " + pid);
```

<hr/>

* Check whether a PID is alive

```java
int pid = Integer.parseInt(FileUtils.readFileToString(new File("pidfile")));
PidProcess process = Processes.newPidProcess(pid);
boolean isAlive = process.isAlive();
System.out.println("PID " + pid + " is alive: " + isAlive);
```

<hr/>

* Check whether a process is alive

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("my-application").start();
JavaProcess process = Processes.newJavaProcess(p);
boolean isAlive = process.isAlive();
System.out.println("Process " + process + " is alive: " + isAlive);
```

<hr/>

* Wait until an already started process has finished

```java
int pid = Integer.parseInt(FileUtils.readFileToString(new File("pidfile")));
PidProcess process = Processes.newPidProcess(pid);
boolean finished = process.waitFor(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
System.out.println("PID " + pid + " finished on time: " + finished);
```

<hr/>

* Wait until the started process has finished

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("my-application").start();
JavaProcess process = Processes.newJavaProcess(p);
boolean finished = process.waitFor(10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);
System.out.println("Process " + process + " finished on time: " + finished);
```

<hr/>

* Stop an already started process, timeout of 30 seconds for graceful stop, timeout of 10 seconds for forceful stop

```java
int pid = Integer.parseInt(FileUtils.readFileToString(new File("pidfile")));
PidProcess process = Processes.newPidProcess(pid);
ProcessUtil.destroyGracefullyOrForcefullyAndWait(process, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

<hr/>

* Stop the started process, timeout of 30 seconds for graceful stop, timeout of 10 seconds for forceful stop

```java
Process p = new ProcessBuilder("my-application").start();
SystemProcess process = Processes.newStandardProcess(p);
ProcessUtil.destroyGracefullyOrForcefullyAndWait(process, 30, TimeUnit.SECONDS, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```
